- 👀 I’m interested in
1.Exploring New ReactJS Features:
As a frontend developer, I'm always eager to dive deep into the latest features and updates in ReactJS. Whether it's hooks, context API, or concurrent mode, I enjoy experimenting with new tools and techniques to enhance the performance and maintainability of our React applications.
2.Performance Optimization:
Optimizing the performance of React applications is crucial for delivering a smooth user experience. I'm interested in exploring strategies such as code splitting, lazy loading, and memoization to improve loading times and runtime performance.
3.React Ecosystem:
Beyond React core, I'm also keen on exploring the wider React ecosystem, including popular libraries like Redux, React Router, and Material-UI. Integrating these tools effectively into our projects can streamline development and unlock powerful capabilities.
